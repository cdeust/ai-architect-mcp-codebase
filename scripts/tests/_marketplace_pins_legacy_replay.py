"""Frozen, verbatim copies of pre-fix check_marketplace_pins.py logic
(git blame: pre-e0661ad9), kept ONLY so the incident-replay tests in
test_check_marketplace_pins.py can prove the historical defect existed —
by executing the actual old code against the actual historical inputs —
rather than merely asserting it in prose. Split into its own file (issue:
test_check_marketplace_pins.py crossed the 300-line §4.1 cap once this
coverage was added).

Never call these outside a test, and never "fix" them — the whole point
is that they reproduce the bug.
