"""Public MCP registry cross-check for the marketplace pin-staleness gate.

Split out of check_marketplace_pins.py (issue: that file crossed the
300-line §4.1 cap once this module was added). The public MCP registry
(registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) is a THIRD version surface — independent
of the marketplace pin and PyPI — that server.json's own "name" field
names an entry for. Measured 2026-08-10: io.github.cdeust/hypermnesia-mcp
was published at 4.17.1 while the tag/server.json/PyPI were already at
4.17.2, invisible until queried directly (same failure shape as #179 and
PIN_VERSION_UNPUBLISHED — a mandatory per-release step that lived only in
prose, with nothing committed to run it or verify it happened).

# credential this agent does not hold (`mcp-publisher login` needs either
# an interactive GitHub OAuth browser flow or a personal access token) and
# was correctly refused when attempted; a maintainer with real
